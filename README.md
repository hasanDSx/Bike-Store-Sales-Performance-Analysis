üîç Data Analysis with SQL Server
________________________________________

I worked on the Bike Store dataset across 9 tables to uncover key business insights, such as:

‚Ä¢ Analyzing store performance and contribution to total sales

‚Ä¢ Breaking down revenue by city, product category, and brand

‚Ä¢ Tracking monthly orders, sales, and revenue trends

‚Ä¢ Identifying best and worst months per store

‚Ä¢ Comparing inventory levels versus sold quantities

‚Ä¢ Evaluating shipping performance and customer distribution

________________________________________
Here‚Äôs how I approached the analysis:


‚Ä¢ Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries using multiple CTEs, subqueries, and rollups

‚Ä¢ Applying window functions like SUM() OVER(), ROW_NUMBER(), and RANK() to track trends and performance

‚Ä¢ Cleaning and standardizing data across all tables to ensure accuracy and consistency

‚Ä¢ Applying time intelligence analysis to measure monthly, yearly, and category-wise growth

‚Ä¢ Segmenting data by store, city, product category, and brand to uncover patterns


‚Ä¢ Using conditional logic to evaluate performance gaps and shipping delays

üìä Interactive Dashboard Design in Power BI


I built a fully dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that presents the results clearly and supports better decision-making, including:


‚Ä¢ Tracking total sales, revenue, and orders with month-over-month and year-over-year trends

‚Ä¢ Dynamic breakdowns by store, city, product category, and brand

‚Ä¢ Automatically highlighting top-performing stores, products, and months

‚Ä¢ Interactive drill-downs for multi-level analysis

‚Ä¢ Customized tooltips to display key performance indicators and insights in a user-friendly way
